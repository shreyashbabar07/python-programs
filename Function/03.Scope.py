'''Scope : A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope.'''

'''Local Scope : A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.'''

# A variable created inside a function is available inside that function:

def myfunc():
    x = 300
    print(x)

myfunc()

'''Function Inside Function: As explained in the example above, the variable x is not available outside the function, but it is available for any function inside the function:'''

# The local variable can be accessed from a function within the function:
def func():
    x = 300
    def myinnerfunc():
        print(x)
    myinnerfunc()

myfunc

'''Global Scope :
    A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope.

    Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.'''

x = 300

def myfunc():
    print(x)

myfunc()
print(x)

'''Naming Variables : If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, Python will treat them as two separate variables, one available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function):'''

# Example : The function will print the local x, and then the code will print the global x.

x = 300

def myfunc():
    x = 200
    print(x)

myfunc()
print(x)



'''Global Keyword :
    If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global keyword.

    The global keyword makes the variable global.'''

#Example
#If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:

def myfunc():
    global x
    x = 400

myfunc()

# Also, use the global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function.

# Example :
# To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:

x = 300

def myfunc():
    global x
    x = 200

myfunc()
print(x)

''' Nonlocal Keyword : 
    The nonlocal keyword is used to work with variable inside a functions
    The nonlocal keyword makes the variable belong to the outer function. '''

# Example: If you use the nonlocal keyword, the variable will belong to the other function.

def myfunc1():
    x = "Hello"
    def myfunc2():
        nonlocal x
        x = "hello"
    myfunc2()
    return x

print(myfunc1())


''' The LGEB Rule 
    python follows the LEGB rule when looking up variable names, and searches for them tn this order
    1. Local - Inside the current function
    2. Enclosing - Inside enclosing functions (from inner to outer)
    3. Gobal - At the top level of the module
    4. Bult in - In python built in namespace'''

# Understanding the LEGB rule

x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"
    def inner():
        x = "local"
        print("Inner:, x")
    inner()
    print("Outer:", x)

outer()
print("Global:, x")
